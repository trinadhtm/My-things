1.       What is GlideAjax?
The GlideAjax class is used by client-side scripts to send data to and receive data from the ServiceNow server. The client-side script passes parameters to the Script Include. The Script Include returns data as XML or a JSON object.
 
2.       Difference between UI Poicy and Data Policy.
Data policies are similar to UI policies, but UI policies only apply to data entered on a form through the standard browser. Data policies can apply rules to all data entered into the system, including data brought in through email, import sets or web services and data entered through the mobile UI

3.       Difference between After Business Rule and Async Business Rule.
Ans:
Business Rule works on the server.async means the form will be loaded even if there is no response from the server. When the response comes it will be reflected on the form(Asynchronous).
 
After Business Rule runs after the user submits the forms and after any action is taken on the record in the database.

4.       When to use Client Script irrespective of UI Policy.
5.       What is Coalesce in Import sets?
Ans:Coalesce is a field property that is used in transform map field mapping. When you use coalesce on a field, you can use that field as a unique key. If a match is found coalesce field is found, the existing record will be updated with the imported information

Configuring a target field to coalesce causes the import set to treat the field as a unique key. When selected, the import set application attempts to match source values to records with values from an existing record. If a match is found, the transform map updates the record instead of creating a new record. When false, the import set application always creates new records for each transformation. If multiple fields are set to coalesce, all coalesce values must match an existing record. If two fields are set for coalescing and a matching value is found for one of the coalescing fields but not on the other, a new record is inserted.

Client Scripts and catalog Client Scripts are virtually the exact same sort of script. The differences are that client scripts execute against a form with a certain type of record, whereas catalog Client Scripts execute against a certain catalog item or variable set within a catalog item.

function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate)
function onCellEdit(sysIDs, table, oldValues, newValue, callback) 

6.       What is mail script? How to use in Email Notification?
Use Notification Email Scripts to print Notification message content from a server-side script. Although Notification Email Scripts are application files, they must be created in the main ServiceNow browser window and not in Studio.

7.       Describe all types of Business rules in the sequence of their flow with example.

8.       What is rule base?
Ans:
The purpose of a rule base on an order guide include catalog items into your order depending on when you wa1t to include the item.
or example, if you have a new hire order guide with checkboxes for applications for users to request, you can configure each application checkbox to have a specific catalog item added to your order.

9.       What is Record producer?
Ans:
Record producers in Service-now allow users to create records on any table directly from the Service catalog interface. Typically, record producers are used to allow users to create incident or change request records.

10.  What are the differences between Parallel Flow & Sub flow?
11.  What is automated test framework? When to utilize it?
